# Welcome to DoodleDo

I think a simple doodle on the corner of a notebook or a sketch on a journal that was never meant to see the light, holds as much power as a full body oil painting or fresco. Have you ever seen [Van Gogh's sketches](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0520/1625/1049/files/Van_Gogh2_600x600.jpg?v=1615408585)? They will bring a tear to your eye! 
I've always been moved by the naive strokes of the carefree artist, that doodles and draws because the emotion of the moment requires it. And yet, those drawings rarely get published!

I seldom publish my art online because I deemed it too simple or unfinished, and those pretty drawings get lost, scattered among dozens of notebooks or hundreds of pprocreate files.  

I wanted this website to be an archive for artists to store their spontaneous art. And also a place where the bar of what's finished or publishable gets lowered, or better put, a club for doodle enthusiasts. 

Thanks for coming by, I'm excited to see your doodles, or garabatos, as we say in Spanish.
